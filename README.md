# channel-network
Web template for channel network (anything e.g. podcast, videos learning and others)

# Tools
Similar with previous projects, I'm using Sublime Text editor and Prepros. Jade and Sass, as usual, play a significant important part in developing this web template. Ongoing project that I really enjoy to contribute.
